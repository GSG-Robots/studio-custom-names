# studio-custom-names

This Tool allows you to use custom part names in Stud.io, in case you struggle with bricklink's names.
This is made for windows, but may also work on linux machines.

## Usage

1. Get your Studio Installation Path.
  Search for Studio in the start menu and select "Open file location". If you see a single file in the next window, right click it and select "Open file location" there as well.
  Now copy the path of this folder.
2. Run "main.py" and paste the path you copied in the first step.
3. If Studio is running, close it first. Start Studio and enjoy your custom part names.
